      <h1>René Magritte</h1>
      <p>November 21, 1898 - August 15, 1967</p>
      <p>Rene Magritte was an internationally acclaimed surrealist artist of all time, yet it was not until his 50s,
        when he was finally able to reach some form of fame and recognition for his work.
      Often depicting ordinary objects in an unusual context,
        his work is known for challenging observers' preconditioned perceptions of reality. His imagery has influenced pop art, minimalist art and conceptual art.</p>
